Creating custom application event

In Spring applications, a custom application event is a user-defined class that extends the ApplicationEvent class.

**Purpose:**
- Enables loosely coupled communication between components.
- Allows components to react asynchronously to events without tight dependencies.
- Provides a structured way to handle application lifecycle events.

**Usage:**

**Publishing the Event:**

- In the part of your code where you want to trigger the event, you create an instance of your custom event class.
- You then use an ApplicationEventPublisher bean (provided by Spring) to publish the event. This broadcasts the event to any registered listeners.

**Real time applications:**
Here are a couple of real-time application examples of custom events in Spring:

1. Asynchronous Task Processing:
●	Scenario: Imagine a web application where users upload large files. You don't want the file upload process to block the user's request.
●	Solution:
○	Define a FileUploadedEvent class extending ApplicationEvent with the uploaded file information.
○	Upon successful file upload, publish a FileUploadedEvent.
○	Have a separate background listener service (@Async annotation) subscribed to this event.
○	The listener asynchronous processes the uploaded file (e.g., resize, store in database). This keeps the user experience smooth and avoids blocking the main request.

2. Caching Invalidation:
●	Scenario: You have a caching layer for frequently accessed data in your application. When the underlying data source is updated, the cache needs to be invalidated to ensure data consistency.
●	Solution:
○	Define a DataUpdatedEvent class extending ApplicationEvent with the specific data entity or ID that was updated.
○	Whenever data is updated in the database or any persistent storage, publish a DataUpdatedEvent.
○	Have a cache invalidation listener subscribed to this event.
○	The listener invalidates the relevant cache entries associated with the updated data, ensuring the cache reflects the latest changes.

3. Distributed System Communication:
●	Scenario: In a microservices architecture, you might have multiple services working together. When a user performs an action in one service, it might trigger actions in another service.
●	Solution:
○	Define custom events specific to the interactions between services (e.g., OrderPlacedEvent, PaymentReceivedEvent).
○	When a user places an order in the order service, publish an OrderPlacedEvent.
○	Have a message listener in the payment service subscribed to this event.
○	The payment service listener can then initiate the payment process upon receiving the OrderPlacedEvent. This enables communication and coordination between independent services.

4. System Monitoring and Alerts:
●	Scenario: You want to monitor critical events within your application and trigger alerts if necessary.
●	Solution:
○	Define custom events for critical situations (e.g., OutOfStockEvent, LowMemoryEvent).
○	In your application logic, publish these events when specific conditions are met (e.g., low stock levels, memory pressure).
○	Have a monitoring listener subscribed to these events.
○	The listener can trigger alerts (e.g., email notifications, log messages) when such events occur, allowing for proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.
